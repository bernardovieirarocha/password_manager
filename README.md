# Password Manager Project

Welcome to the Password Manager GitHub repository! This project was initiated with the aim of delving deeper into the realm of cryptography, exploring database management, and addressing a practical issue of forgetting passwords.
## Project Overview:

The Password Manager project offers a simple yet functional web-based solution for managing passwords. It includes:

    Login/Sign-up System: Users can create accounts, log in securely, and access their password storage area.

    Password Storage: Once logged in, users can store and retrieve their passwords within the protected area.

## Key Learnings:

This project provided valuable insights into cryptography, database management, and the intricacies of web security. Key takeaways include:

    Understanding Cryptography: Through the development process, the project creator gained a deeper understanding of cryptographic principles and their application in password management.

    Database Management: Working with databases within a web application context helped in understanding data storage and retrieval mechanisms.

    Real-World Application: The project addressed a genuine need for managing passwords effectively, offering a practical solution to a common problem.

## Project Status:

Although development on this project was halted some years ago, it remains a valuable learning experience. It was abandoned due to the realization that self-built password management solutions are inherently risky compared to established, professionally maintained options like Bitwarden and 1Password.
Important Note:

It's crucial to highlight that creating custom password management systems poses significant security risks. Such systems require extensive expertise, constant monitoring, and collaboration to ensure robust security measures.
# Conclusion:

While the Password Manager project was ultimately discontinued, it provided valuable insights into security practices and web development. It stands as a testament to the importance of understanding security principles and leveraging established solutions for sensitive tasks like password management.
